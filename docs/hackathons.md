# Hackathons

![Hackathons Overview](/img/hackathons/hackathons-1.png)

## Context

Participating in various hackathons to create innovative solutions under time constraints.

## Tovarishi Project

We took 3rd place at the regional stage of the Digital Breakthrough hackathon. Over the weekend we made a mobile SPA app for searching and distributing orders on the student campus.

### Problem Statement
There is a student campus that is located on an island. There are few stores on the island and prices are higher than in the city. Students buy food in the city and take it to their dorms by bus. There are no deliveries that bring food from the city to the island.
We need to offer the best solution to the students' problem.

### Research and Insights
- We communicated with university students, learning about their problems and getting information that we used to develop solutions.
- We found out that many students have cars and would like to earn money.
- The students without a car were willing to pay between 300 and 500 rubles for delivering groceries.

### Solution
We made a system that allows us to connect students and professors who have a car and free time and students who want goods in the dorms.

## Hunt U Project

We reached the finals of the Digital Breakthrough hackathon. In 48 hours we built a working prototype of the product. We made a tool for comparing jobs and the most suitable candidates.

### Problem Statement
Job creation and initial selection of candidates takes a lot of time for recruiters and IT managers.

### Process and Solution
We talked to recruiters and team leaders and found out what activities they spend the most time on and tried to optimize and automate them. We analyzed existing solutions on the market and built the value of our solution.

We designed a service with:
- Job builder
- Job and resume comparison
- Candidate ranking based on past experience
- Automatic rejection sending to unsuitable candidates
