# Hackatons

### Context

**Role:** UX Designer  
**Year:** 2023-2024  
**Event:** [Digital Breakthrough Hackathon](https://leadersofdigital.ru/)

Participating in various hackathons to create innovative solutions under time constraints.

The main projects included the Tovarishi project, where we created a mobile SPA app for campus order distribution, and the Hunt U project, a tool for job and candidate matching. Both projects demonstrated our ability to quickly analyze problems and develop effective solutions under tight deadlines.
