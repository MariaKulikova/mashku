# CDN Service Redesign Story

![Redesign Overview](/img/story-redesign/storyRedesign-1.png)

## What is CDN?

CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a network of data caching servers. They speed up the delivery of static content to end users. This can include website elements, videos and photos, gaming content, software updates, and even streaming.

Caching servers are located around the world. If your resources are used in Amsterdam, for example, CDN will choose the server closest to the city for fast content delivery. This way, the time between user request and resource response will be minimal.

## Research

I analyzed the entire journey from the service page on the website to registration in the control panel and ordering a CDN resource.

I studied user behavior and found points in the journey where about 30% of clients abandon the order.

I analyzed more than 100 user sessions to understand common patterns and pain points.

## Prototyping and Testing

I created interactive prototypes and tested them with colleagues. We conducted expert evaluation with designers and made adjustments based on feedback.

## Solution

### Resource Creation Form
I modified the resource creation form and added tooltips at each step to guide users through the process.

### Resource Verification
I developed a resource verification page to help users confirm their setup.

## Results Analysis

After implementation, we collected data on the results of our solution. The conversion rate increased by 25%, indicating a significant improvement in the user experience and successful completion of resource creation.
