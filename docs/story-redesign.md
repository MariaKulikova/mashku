### Context

**Role:** UX Designer  
**Year:** 2023-2024  
**Company:** [Selectel](https://selectel.ru/)

CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a network of data caching servers that speed up the delivery of static content to end users. This includes website elements, videos, photos, gaming content, software updates, and streaming services.

The system works by utilizing caching servers located worldwide. For example, if resources are accessed from Amsterdam, CDN selects the nearest server to ensure minimal response time between user requests and content delivery.

### Problem and Tasks

Through analysis, we identified that approximately 30% of clients were abandoning the service during the order process. Our task was to analyze the entire user journey from the service page through registration and CDN resource ordering, identify pain points, and implement improvements to reduce drop-off rates.

### Process

Our approach involved several key phases:

1. Research
- Analyzed over 100 user sessions
- Identified common patterns and pain points
- Mapped the complete user journey
- Documented key drop-off points

2. Prototyping and Testing
- Created interactive prototypes
- Conducted expert evaluations with designers
- Gathered and incorporated feedback
- Iterated on designs based on testing results
