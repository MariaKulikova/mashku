### Context

**Role:** UX Designer  
**Year:** 2023-2024  
**Company:** [Selectel](https://selectel.ru/)

The project focused on creating and implementing a unified design system for Selectel's products.

### Problem and Tasks

The main challenge was to establish consistency across Selectel's various products and improve the efficiency of the design and development process. We needed to create a comprehensive design system that would serve as a single source of truth for both designers and developers.

### Process

Our approach involved several key phases:

1. System Architecture
- Created the foundational structure for the design system
- Established component relationships and hierarchies
- Developed standardized patterns for implementation
