  # Simplifying Act Requests at Marquiz

</div>

<section className="section-margin">

### Context

At Marquiz, a survey and lead generation platform, I worked on optimizing the work completion act request process. Many clients needed these documents for accounting purposes, but the existing process was manual and time-consuming, leading to delays and numerous support requests.

### Research

The key issues we identified through user research and support ticket analysis were:
- Manual process requiring significant support team involvement
- Delays in document generation and delivery
- Lack of standardization in request format
- No way for users to track request status
- High volume of follow-up support requests

</section>

### Solution

We developed a streamlined process that:
1. Standardized the request format
2. Added automated validation
3. Implemented request status tracking
4. Created clear user communication at each step
