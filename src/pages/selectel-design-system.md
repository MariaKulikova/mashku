# Selectel Design System

</div>

<section className="section-margin">

#### Context
Selectel had several digital products, and each had its own design approach. This made it hard to keep the user experience consistent. Our goal was to build a unified design system that would help both designers and developers work faster and stay aligned.

I worked as part of a horizontal design team. We discussed ideas, agreed on patterns, and made decisions together â€” from naming to behavior. This helped us create a system that reflected real needs and worked across all products.

#### My role


<div>
  I helped to work on the core structure of the design system and create components like the Skeleton and Stepper with clear documentation and behavior rules. 
  
  I also led the work on improving the navigation system, which affected all products. This included analyzing user pain points and coordinating with different teams to agree on a new, consistent approach that solved real problems. Throughout the process, I stayed in close contact with developers to keep design and implementation in sync.

#### Results

We analyzed existing interfaces, identified common patterns, and built a component library in Figma with tokens, templates, and documentation. Then we worked with developers to bring everything into code, reviewed implementation, and made improvements along the way. 

As a result, we launched a full design system now used by all product teams. It sped up development, improved interface consistency, and made collaboration between design and development much smoother.
