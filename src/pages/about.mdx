  #### Who am I
  I am Product Designer based in Luxembourg. 
  
  #### Approach

  - Imperfect working product is more important than perfect design. I believe that design is an iterative process, and I am always open to feedback and suggestions for improvement. I strive to create designs that are not only visually appealing but also functional and user-friendly. I believe that the best designs are those that solve real problems and enhance the user experience.
  - Everybody can offer a great idea and make product better. Not only Designer.
