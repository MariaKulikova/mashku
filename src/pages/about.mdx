  #### Who I am
 
 I design complex B2C and B2B products in a wide range of fields, including AI, CloudTech, E-com and MarTech.
  Right now, I'm working on an AI assistant project with the University of Luxembourg.
   

  #### Approach
 
  - A working product is more important than perfect mockups.
  - Designers should stay involved throughout the entire problem-solving process.
	- My work is not just about screens ‚Äî it‚Äôs about solved problems and happy users.
	- The design process is a tool, not a fixed rulebook. It should adapt to the project.
	- I value research, but sometimes it‚Äôs better to launch quickly and test.
	- Great ideas can come from anyone. I believe in flexibility over ego.
