### Context

I worked at Selectel, one of the leading cloud and data center service providers in Russia. I was responsible for the full user experience, including research and design, for the CDN and Cloud Storage products.

In this case, I want to share a story about one specific challenge we faced while improving the CDN product. At some point, we noticed a large number of support requests â€” over 40% of them were about the resource status. Many users didn't understand when the CDN becomes active, how to connect a custom domain, or how to check if the setup was completed successfully.

### Research

<div className="columns">
  <div>
    I reviewed the full user journey from product page to resource creation and found key drop-off points where around 30% of users left. This mostly affected non-technical users who relied on the UI. 
    I analyzed over 2,000 support tickets and watched 100+ user sessions. 

    Users filled out the form, clicked "Create", didn't see feedback, and got confused. Some saw a blocked button and didn't know what to do

### Usability Testing

I prepared interactive prototypes and conducted usability testing with non-technical users. The tests went smoothly and revealed no critical issues.

  ### Design

   We've added a verification screen with CNAME setup tips, helpful instructions, and a built-in checker to confirm everything is working.

   We've improved the resource creation form by adding custom domain and SSL fields, automating protocol selection, and showing a low-balance warning.

### Design System Development

As part of improving the overall user experience, I helped develop a comprehensive design system for Selectel. The goal was to unify the design approach across all digital products and improve development efficiency.

I worked as part of a horizontal design team where we collaborated on patterns, naming conventions, and behavior standards. This unified approach helped create a system that met real needs across all products.

#### My Role in Design System
I contributed to the core structure and created key components like the Skeleton and Stepper, complete with clear documentation and behavior rules. I also led the navigation system improvements, which impacted all products.
